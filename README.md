# Dispatch Adobe Commerce Plugin
[Dispatch - Marketplace Listing](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/dispatch-sales-channel.html)

Dispatch enables merchants using Adobe Commerce (Magento 2) to engage and sell products to customers directly through various sales and marketing channels.

Your implementation will allow your business to start selling in new channels with Dispatch, while having orders and payments processed through existing PSP, just like your businessâ€™s ecommerce website.

## AdobeCommerce Integration Keys
Dispatch needs an AdobeCommerce Integration configured so it has access to create orders and sync products on your behalf. Dispatch never accesses any data unrelated to the Products and Orders it serves via your configured Dispatch Sales Channels.

The integration needs access to the following resources to read product data and create orders on your behalf:

- Sales
- - Operations 
- - Billing Agreements
- - Transactions
- - Shopping Cart Management
- - Catalog (Readonly)
- - Categories (Readonly)
- - Carts
- Stores
- - Settings (Sitemap, developer, analytics etc. not needed)
- - Inventory (Readonly)
- - Stocks (Sales Stock only)
- - Taxes
- - Currency
- - Attributes

If you have any concerns or questions about these permissions, contact your Dispatch representative. 

Once you have configured this key, you need to share it with your account rep or email support@dispatch.co to request secure transmission of this key.

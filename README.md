# SalesChannel By Dispatch

Dispatch enables merchants using Adobe Commerce (Magento 2) to engage and sell products to customers directly through various sales and marketing channels.

## What does it do?

Your implementation will allow your business to start selling in new channels with Dispatch, while having orders and payments processed through existing PSP, just like your businessâ€™s ecommerce website.
